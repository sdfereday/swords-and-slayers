This is a much simpler platformer by design. The simple premise is that you proceed through various levels with more of a focus on slashing things, and fulfilling puzzles. It's less about jumping really and more about finding the right bits to press or jingle.

Even then it's mostly flat with a lot of action as opposed to jump puzzles per say.
