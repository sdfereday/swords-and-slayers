A war once raged between the northern realms and the southern kingdoms lasting for one hundred years. Driven by a deep routed hatred, and an excuse long forgotten, it was a tiresome century for all.

To 'gracefully' end the war, the ruler of the north called upon his best and brightest mages in an attempt to harness magical constructs and weapons from the realm of nightmares. Alas, it's power proved too much for them to contain, and through it arrived the queen of nightmares herself... Tavnera.

It wasn't long before Tavnera declared her grasp upon the north. Enslaving all who turned against her, the realm of nightmares began tighten its grip upon the world. The hundred year war it would seem was indeed now over. Replaced by a new enemy - darkness.

However, as if a blessing from the stars themselves, a small band of warriors would take matters in to their own hands whilst all else cowered under the terrifying might of the goddess of nightmares.

With unfathomable power, courage and spirit, they raised their blades towards the darkness to put an end to the final nightmare and to see peace return after a century of madness...
