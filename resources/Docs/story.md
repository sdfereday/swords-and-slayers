- Hundred year war of the Dwarven clans has begun, with land and resource under threat, old blood rivals begin to fight each other for claim.- Unrest everywhere you turn, even though the landscapes are quite beautiful, some is war torn also.- You and your small clan get mixed up in it and cross blades with an evil clan who's moved in to the lands, wanting to take everything for themselves. They kidnap who doesn't resist, everyone but yourself, the leader, and those who resist. They slay your leader in the process (along with those who did resist, leaving you for dead). The leaders dying breath is for you to save the people of your clan from this terrible fate.- End up travelling the realms to save your clan from the evil clan, you pick up your blade and go to rescue them.- First chapter over, the rest is you slowly bringing the Dwarven people together. Meeting other races, etc. But that's for another day.
